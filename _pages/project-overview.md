The project is organised into 5 workpackages.

## WP 1: UKSRC Project Office ## (lead: Dr Louise Chisholm)
The project office will provide project management, reporting and delivery of a work-programme that addresses the UKSRC Strategy. In liaison with UKSRC stakeholders, provide strategic 
guidance of the project delivery. 
## WP2: Technical Development workstream ## (lead: Dr Paul Callija, Deputy: Ian Collier)
This workstream will build a functioning UK node of SRCNet which will have 20% of the capacity and 80% of the functionality of what will be
