# Our History # 
## UK SKA Regional Centre Forum ##
The UK contirbuted to international working groups to understand the SRC Network requirements.
* WG0: SRC Network Architecture	
* WG1: Data Logistics Working Group	 
* WG2: Operations Working Group	
* WG3: SW Federated Computing and Data Software Services	
* WG4: SW, Science Archive-VO-FAIR	
* WG5: Compute Working Group
* WG6: Science User Engagement 
 
Between May - July 2022 the UKSRC Forum engaged with >150 UK-based academics, researchers, industry leaders and outreach professionals through 3 town halls (organised with the UK SKA Science Committee), 2 workshops, and 3 focus groups during the proposal develoment phase of the UKSRC Project 2023-2025). These discussions contributed to the development of the UKSRC Project's astronomy science demonstrator cases, outreach and knowledge exchange activities. We would like to thank everyone who participated for their valuable time and insights.
