Due to the sheer volume of data the SRCNet will have to transport, process, store and distribute to its end users around the globe, the SKA project is considered by many the ultimate Big Data challenge. To give a sense of scale, the SKAO is expected to archive 300 petabytes of data per year.  

Observatory Level Data Products (OLDPs) produced by the Science Data Processor (SDP) supercomputers are intended to reduce the data volume that is captured the telescopes. This will enable the data to be delivered to a network of SKA Regional Centres which will provide processing and storage support for the astronomy community.

UK astronomers will need to be able to efficiently access, analyse and visualise the vast amounts of data the SKA will produce. This data, in the form of Observatory Data Products (ODPs) will be stored within the UK SRC Node. The processing of this data, on the UK SRC Node, by UK astronomers will produce Advanced Data Products (ADPs), which will enable the science exploitation of the SKA. 

To minimise time to science the platform must, to the astronomer, be as easily accessible as the software running on their laptop and have access to the data captured by SKA (ODPs) along with the computing power of a world class supercomputer. This hardware and technology that will enable this vision together with the technologies required to enable data movement and storage for SKA sized data (ODPs). It will ensure that all ODPs and ADPs are FAIR – that data products are easily Findable, easily Accessible, that data products are Interoperable (meaning that data can be used by all applicable software / workflows) and vitally that they are Reusable. Along with the above, the UKSRC will deliver the science analysis platform, enabling analysis and visualisation of SKA data.

The UKSRC Project will undertake technical research to develop improve the to build on the UK’s existing leadership in cloud computing, data logistics, data archives, identify access and authorisation, and science platforms. The Project will also develop digital research infrastructure professionals who will produce and maintain these resources (e.g., research software engineers, data stewards, etc). These new technologies to enable the analysis of huge data volumes across disciplines, beyond radio astronomy. As a partner of IRIS and knowledge exchange activities will enable UK industry and other UK-based Digital Research Infrastructures to benefit from these advancements.  

The success of the UKSRC, and SRCNet, requires cross-disciplinary expertise, in addition to wide national and international collaboration with associated infrastructures, services providers, projects, and science communities.
