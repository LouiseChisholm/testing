The Square Kilometer Array is an exascale data challenge - each telescope is expected to create ~300 petabytes per year, creating an archive of ~8.5 exabytes during the initial high-priority science programmes [1]. The SKAO's Science Data Processors will calibrate and reduce the telescope data to a volume that can be transfered (as Observatory Level Data Products, OLDPs) via intercontinental telecommunications networks to SKA Regional Centre nodes.   

The network of SKA Regional Centres (SRCNet) are developing an internationally interoperable digital research infrastructure which will enable astronomers to efficiently access, analyse and visualise the data. To minimise time to science the platform must, to the astronomer, be as easily accessible as the software running on their laptop and have access to the data captured by SKA (OLDPs) along with the computing power of a world class supercomputer.   

Six components have been identified for the SRCNet’s community and SKA Observatory facing functionalities:
* Data Logistics - deliver OLDPs from the Observatory to SRCs; make data accessible by authorized users; enable the flow of data between SRCs 
* Commonality - support a common and minimum set of tools/interfaces/systems, within appropriate standards, that can be deployed across the SRCNet
* Data Processing – provide the computational and storage resources and services, together with programming and execution environments, needed to interact with and analyse the delivered data.  
* Data Archiving and Curation – provide a functional and persistent SKA Science Archive incorporating FAIR and VO services that allows data discovery, access, use and reuse, new science and scientific reproducibility as well as data provenance all along the full data cycle
* Scalable Resource Management and Allocation - enable and support an interface to the observatory Time Allocation Committee (TAC) and to the broad SRC user community, allowing a variety of science-driven applications to share efficiently across and within the SRC nodes a flexible set of logistically centralised core services and the resources they require. 


The UKSRC Project will grow the UKSRC’s and SRCNet’s capabilities, and to deploy an initial version of SRCNet at the national level through engagement with SKA precursor and pathfinder science programs and international SRCNet prototyping teams.   

The technologies being developed have the potential to be applied by other diciplines which also plan to analyse huge data volumes. As a partner of IRIS and UKSRC's knowledge exchange activities will enable UK industry and other UK-based Digital Research Infrastructures to benefit from these technological developments.
