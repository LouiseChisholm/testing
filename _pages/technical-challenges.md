The Square Kilometer Array is an exascale data challenge - each telescope is expected to create ~300 petabytes per year, creating an archive of ~8.5 exabytes during the initial high-priority science programmes [1]. The Science Data Processors based at each telescope will produce Observatory Level Data Products (OLDPs) which will calibrate and reduced the telescope timestream data to a volume that can be transfered internationally via intercontinental telecommunications networks to SKA Regional Centre nodes.   

The network of SKA Regional Centres (SRCNet) are developing an internationally interoperable digital research infrastructure which will enable astronomers to efficiently access, analyse and visualise the data. To minimise time to science the platform must, to the astronomer, be as easily accessible as the software running on their laptop and have access to the data captured by SKA (OLDPs) along with the computing power of a world class supercomputer.   

Six components have been identified for the SRCNet’s community and SKA Observatory facing functionalities: Data Logistics, Commonality, Data Processing, Data Archiving and Curation, Scalable Resource Management and Allocation, and User Support.

This hardware and technology that will enable this vision together with the technologies required to enable data movement and storage for SKA sized data (ODPs). It will ensure that all ODPs and ADPs are FAIR – that data products are easily Findable, easily Accessible, that data products are Interoperable (meaning that data can be used by all applicable software / workflows) and vitally that they are Reusable. Along with the above, the UKSRC will deliver the science analysis platform, enabling analysis and visualisation of SKA data.

The UKSRC Project will undertake technical research to develop improve the to build on the UK’s existing leadership in cloud computing, data logistics, data archives, identify access and authorisation, and science platforms. The Project will also develop digital research infrastructure professionals who will produce and maintain these resources (e.g., research software engineers, data stewards, etc). These new technologies to enable the analysis of huge data volumes across disciplines, beyond radio astronomy. As a partner of IRIS and knowledge exchange activities will enable UK industry and other UK-based Digital Research Infrastructures to benefit from these advancements.  

The success of the UKSRC, and SRCNet, requires cross-disciplinary expertise, in addition to wide national and international collaboration with associated infrastructures, services providers, projects, and science communities.
