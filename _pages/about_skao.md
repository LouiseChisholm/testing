## SKA Observatory (SKAO) ##
The SKAO is an intergovernmental organisation bringing together nations from around the world. Its mission is to build and operate cutting-edge radio telescopes to transform our understanding of the Universe, and deliver benefits to society through global collaboration and innovation. The observatory has a global footprint and consists of the SKAO Global Headquarters in the UK, the SKAOâ€™s two telescopes at radio-quiet sites in South Africa and Australia, and associated facilities to support the operations of the telescopes.

## SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) ## 
Member states are developing an internationally interoperable network of SKA Regional Centres (SRCs) will provide access to data products, platforms for advanced scientific analysis, and user support and training for astronomers using data generated by the SKA telescopes.
