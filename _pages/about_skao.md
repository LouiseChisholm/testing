## SKA Observatory (SKAO) ##
The [SKAO](https://www.skao.int/) is an intergovernmental organisation bringing together nations from around the world. Its mission is to build and operate cutting-edge radio telescopes to transform our understanding of the Universe, and deliver benefits to society through global collaboration and innovation. The observatory has a global footprint and consists of the SKAO Global Headquarters in the UK, the SKAOâ€™s [two telescopes (SKA-Low and SKA-Mid)](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/telescopes) at radio-quiet sites in South Africa and Australia, and associated facilities to support the operations of the telescopes.

## Science Data Processing (SDP) ##
An average of 8 terabits per second of data will be transferred from the SKA telescopes in both countries to Central Processing Facilities (CPFs) located at the telescope sites. At these facilities, [SDP supercomputers](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/big-data) will process the data before it is distributed via intercontinental telecommunications networks to the SKA Regional Centres.

## SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) ## 
An internationally interoperable network of SKA Regional Centres [(SRCNet)](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/big-data/362/ska-regional-centres) will provide researchers with access to data products, platforms for advanced scientific analysis, user support and training. These faclilities and services will enable researchers to harness SKA data and revolutionise our understanding of the Universe.
