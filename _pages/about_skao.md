# SKA Observatory (SKAO) #
The SKA Observatory is a next-generation radio astronomy-driven Big Data facility that will revolutionise our understanding of the Universe and the laws of fundamental physics. Enabled by cutting-edge technology, it promises to have a major impact on society, in science and beyond.
Formally known as the SKA Observatory, the SKAO is an intergovernmental organisation bringing together nations from around the world. Its mission is to build and operate cutting-edge radio telescopes to transform our understanding of the Universe, and deliver benefits to society through global collaboration and innovation. 
The observatory has a global footprint and consists of the SKAO Global Headquarters in the UK, the SKAOâ€™s two telescopes at radio-quiet sites in South Africa and Australia, and associated facilities to support the operations of the telescopes.

# SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) # 
An international network of SKA Regional Centres (SRCs will provide access to data products, platforms for advanced scientific analysis, and user support and training for astronomers using data generated by the SKA telescopes.
science community across the member states are developing a collaborative ecosystem -
paradigm where users (and their workflows) are sent "to
 the data" - irrespective of the location or nationality of the user - to avoid data movement bottlenecks wherever possible.
Over the next 6 years the functionality and capacity of resources offered in the global SRCNet collaboration will develop in readiness for full SKA Operations.
There are three key ways of engaging and developing the community: firstly by collaborating in a global software development effort (through community-funded software
development teams at national SRC projects); providing support to users of pathfinder and pre-cursor data and bringing these experiences to bear on the SRCNet system 
designs; and through supporting work done by participating teams in SKA Science Data Challenges - given an opportunity for community members to engage with simulated SKA data products and test their scientific workflows on these developing SRC platforms.
