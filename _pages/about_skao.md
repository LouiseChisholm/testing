## SKA Observatory (SKAO) ##
The [SKAO](https://www.skao.int/) is an intergovernmental organisation bringing together nations from around the world. Its mission is to build and operate cutting-edge radio telescopes to transform our understanding of the Universe, and deliver benefits to society through global collaboration and innovation. The observatory has a global footprint and consists of the SKAO Global Headquarters in the UK, the SKAOâ€™s [two telescopes (SKA-Low and SKA-Mid)](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/telescopes) at radio-quiet sites in South Africa and Australia, and associated facilities to support the operations of the telescopes.

## Science Data Processing (SDP) ##
An average of 8 terabits per second of data will be transferred from the SKA telescopes in both countries to Central Processing Facilities (CPFs) located at the telescope sites. At these facilities, [SDP supercomputers](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/big-data) will process the data before it is distributed via intercontinental telecommunications networks to the SKA Regional Centres.

## SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) ## 
An internationally interoperable network of SKA Regional Centres [(SRCNet)](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/big-data/362/ska-regional-centres) will enable researchers around the world to harness the data generated by the SKA telescopes by providing access to data products, platforms for advanced scientific analysis, user support and training. [Member states](https://www.skao.int/en/partners/skao-members) are funding and developing their respective SRC.
