## SKA Observatory (SKAO) ##
The [SKAO](https://www.skao.int/) is an intergovernmental organisation bringing together nations from around the world. Its mission is to build and operate cutting-edge radio telescopes to transform our understanding of the Universe, and deliver benefits to society through global collaboration and innovation. The observatory has a global footprint and consists of the SKAO Global Headquarters in the UK, the SKAOâ€™s two telescopes at radio-quiet sites in South Africa and Australia, and associated facilities to support the operations of the telescopes.

## Initial Data Processing ##
An average of 8 terabits per second of data will be transferred from the SKA telescopes in both countries to Central Processing Facilities (CPFs) located at the telescope sites. The [Science Data Processor (SDP)](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/big-data) supercomputers will process the data, which will then be distributed via intercontinental telecommunications networks to the SKA Regional Centres.

## SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) ## 
[Member states](https://www.skao.int/en/partners/skao-members) are funding and developing an internationally interoperable network of SKA Regional Centres [(SRCNet)](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/big-data/362/ska-regional-centres). It will enable researchers to harness the data generated by the SKA telescopes by providing access to data products, platforms for advanced scientific analysis, user support and training. STFC is funding the development of the UKSRC.
