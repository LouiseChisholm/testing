## UKSRC Astronomy Community: co-creation, engagement, and training ##
* UKSRC Demonstrator Cases: provides structured support enabling astronomy communities to develop skills in articulating their requirements and testing the proto-UKSRC facility
* UKSRC Champion Scheme: support for community-led initiatives that will enable research communities to develop the skills, knowledge and mindset needed to harness SKA data
* UKSRC Training: developing UKSRC specific resources and training in collaboration with the wider SRCnet and established astronomy summer schools.
## SKAO Science Data Challenges (SDC) ##
To prepare the radio-astronomical community for the novel nature of the data expected from the Square Kilometre Array, realistic, synthetic datasets emulating the telescope's capabilities will be disseminated to test the suitability of existing methods and foster the development of new ones on these next-generation, scientific datasets. [Further information](https://www.skao.int/en/science-users/160/skao-data-challenges) and details of the current challenge, [SDC3](https://sdc3.skao.int/overview).
## UKRI UK SKA Observatory Science Committee (UKSKAOSC) ##
The UKSKAOSC acts as the conduit between the UK-SKA programme and the UK science community, communicating the latest news and project time points, encouraging involvement, and helping to achieve the UK science priorities and objectives from the SKA.
