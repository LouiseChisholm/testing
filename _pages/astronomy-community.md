## SKAO Science Data Challenges (SDC) ##
To prepare the radio-astronomical community for the novel nature of the data expected from the Square Kilometre Array, realistic, synthetic datasets emulating the telescope's capabilities will be disseminated to test the suitability of existing methods and foster the development of new ones on these next-generation, scientific datasets. Ultimately, results of each of the competing teams' approaches will be compared via a standard figure-of-merit, instigating a competitive nature to our challenges. [Further information](https://www.skao.int/en/science-users/160/skao-data-challenges) and details of [SKAO SDC3](https://sdc3.skao.int/overview).
## UKRI UK SKA Observatory Science Committee (UKSKAOSC) ##
The UKSKAOSC acts as the conduit between the UK-SKA programme and the UK science community, communicating the latest news and project time points, encouraging involvement, and helping to achieve the UK science priorities and objectives from the SKA. This is achieved by regular town meetings with the UK science community and via the SKA representative at each of the UKâ€™s universities. The UKSKAOSC meets regularly and provides a platform for communication. [Further information](https://www.ukri.org/about-us/stfc/how-we-are-governed/advisory-boards/ukskasc/)
