## UKSRC Astronomy Community: co-creation, engagement, and training ##
* UKSRC Demonstrator Cases: provides structured support enabling astronomy communities to develop skills in articulating their requirements and testing the proto-UKSRC facility
* UKSRC Champion Scheme: support for community-led initiatives that will enable research communities to develop the skills, knowledge and mindset needed to harness SKA data
* UKSRC Training: developing UKSRC specific resources and training in collaboration with the wider SRCnet and established astronomy summer schools.
* UKSRC HPC facilities and team provides support, alongside other SRC nodes, to enable research groups to participate in the SKAO Science Data Challenges. The SKAO disseminates realistic, synthetic datasets that emulate the telescope's capabilities will to test the suitability of existing methods and foster the development of new ones on these next-generation, scientific datasets. The aim is to prepare the community for the novel nature of the data expected from the Square Kilometre Array.

## UKRI UK SKA Observatory Science Committee (UKSKAOSC) ##
The UKSKAOSC acts as the conduit between the UK-SKA programme and the UK science community, communicating the latest news and project time points, encouraging involvement, and helping to achieve the UK science priorities and objectives from the SKA.
