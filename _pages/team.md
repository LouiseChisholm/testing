![image-left]({{ "/assets/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .align-left} The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150Ã—150 image, which is **left aligned**. There should be plenty of room above, below, and to the right of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that left side. I don't care what the right aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

```markdown
![image-left](/assets/images/filename.jpg){: .align-left}
